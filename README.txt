CONNOR POLLOCK - CS 325 ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS
HW8: PORTFOLIO PROJECT - README.txt

To play the GUI-version of the game, please go to: https://algo-game.pollocco.repl.co
(Requires cookies! [Session is used for saving some variables]).

Refresh the page if you'd like to start over/play again.

To run the game locally, extract the files, run `npm install`,
and then `node app.js XXXX`, where XXXX is the port you wish to use. 
The game will be accessible at http://localhost:XXXX/ (or 
http://localhost:5000/ if no port argument was given).
Press Ctrl+C to stop the server/program.

In order to see the solution algorithm play a set of 7 games,
take out the comment '//' from the beginning of the last line of the
program and then run `node app.js XXXX` (again, XXXX being the port).
Output will print to the console. As this also runs the web server,
press Ctrl+C to exit the app.
